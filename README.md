# ðŸ“š Bookstore Management System 

## Overview 
The bookstore management system is a project I developed in my first year of studying CS for a data base course. The project provides an SQL solution for managing bookstore related information, with its main goal being to facilitate efficient data organization, retrieval, and modification to support the operations of a bookstore.

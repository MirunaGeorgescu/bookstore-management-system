# 📚 Bookstore Management System 

## 🌐 Overview 
The Bookstore Management System is a project I developed in my first year of studying CS for a database course. The project provides an SQL solution for managing bookstore-related information, with its main goal being to facilitate efficient data organization, retrieval, and modification to support the operations of a bookstore.

## 📊 Diagrams
As part of the initial stages of development, both the [entity-relationship diagram (ERD)](https://github.com/MirunaGeorgescu/bookstore-management-system/blob/main/BMS-er-diagram.png) and the [conceptual diagram](https://github.com/MirunaGeorgescu/bookstore-management-system/blob/main/BMS-conceptual-diagram.png) were designed to provide a better understanding of the relationships between entities and to serve as a base for the database structure. 

## 🗃️ Database Tables
The Bookstore Management System makes use of a total of 14 tables to organize and manage information. Here is an overview of the tables: 

  1. Author
  2. Works_with
  3. Publisher
  4. Publishes
  5. Department
  6. Book
  7. Employee
  8. Courier_company
  9. Courier
  10. Client
  11. Individual
  12. Company
  13. Order
  14. Is_part_of

The [documentation](https://github.com/MirunaGeorgescu/bookstore-management-system/blob/main/BMS-organization-and-functioning-of-a-bookstore.pdf) contains in-depth descriptions of the model, operation rules, constraints, etc. 

## 🛠️ Implementation
The Bookstore Management System is entirely implemented using SQL. The database structure, queries, and operations are designed and executed in SQL. To showcase the functionality and structure of the database, sample data was included. This sample data contains relevant information about the books, employees, departments, publishers, and more.
